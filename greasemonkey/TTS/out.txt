Athens. QUINCE'S house.   Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING   QUINCE  <A NAME=1>Have you sent to Bottom's house ? is he come
 home yet?</A>   STARVELING  He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.   FLUTE  If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes not forward, doth it?   QUINCE  It is not possible: you have not a man in all <A NAME=7>Athens able to discharge Pyramus
 but he.</A>   FLUTE  No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.   QUINCE  Yea and the best person too; and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.   FLUTE  You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us, <A NAME=13>a thing of naug
ht.</A> Enter SNUG   SNUG  Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married: if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men.   FLUTE  O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a <A NAME=19>day during his life; he could not have
 'scaped</A> sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged; he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing. Enter BOTTOM   BOTTOM  Where are these lads? where are these hearts?   QUINCE  <A NAME=25>Bottom! O most courageous 
day! O most happy hour!</A>   BOTTOM  Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.   QUINCE  Let us hear, sweet Bottom.   BOTTOM  <A NAME=30>Not a word of me. All that 
I will tell you is, that</A> the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the 
 NAME=38>lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions</A> nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet comedy. No more words: away! go, away! Exeunt          Link to /Shakespeare       |  Link to /Shakespeare/midsummer/       | Act 4, Scene 2
